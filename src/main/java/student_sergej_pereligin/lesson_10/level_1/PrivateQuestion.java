    //Top level class cannot be private, but nested classes can be.
    //They will provide functionality, used within the top level class, but won't be
    //accessible from the outside. Unless called together with the outer class.
    //Reasons to use nested classes - code readability, grouping classes that belong together,
    //better controlled encapsulation.
